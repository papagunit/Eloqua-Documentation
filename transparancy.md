# Transparancy/My Relations

Unlike most you will find writing about this topic, I don't have ties to any organization that is relevant to this book. I am not advocating for or against Eloqua or their competitors. I try to look at Eloqua objectively, and as a tool. You can objectively compare the features and offerings of various tools, but it would be impetuous to declare a particular tool as superior.

Your customer doesn't care what you use. It's not a factor when they are making a purchase. What is a factor is how you use your tool, which depends on skill, creativity, and execution strategy.
