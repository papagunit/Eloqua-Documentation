If you have ever spoken with me personally, you might have heard me say that "Oracle is an old, slow moving whore". It really is. Think about the last time they did anything innovative, were ahead of the curve, or created their own product. They haven't in years. Eloqua, BlueKai, Responsys, Compendium were all acquisitions.
